# Professor Willow Discord Bot

### Purpose
Primary purpose is to organize raids, secondary purpose to have fun!

### What you need
 - Discord
 - Node


Run `npm install` then `npm start` to start the bot, though that said, the login code would likely need to change and point to your own discord server... more details on this process later.

Ignore this next part, it's all for testing purposes...
 - test #1
