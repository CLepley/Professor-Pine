# Professor Willow Discord Bot

### Purpose
Primary purpose is to organize raids, secondary purpose to have fun!

### What you need
 - Discord
 - Node

Once you've cloned to repo, make sure to run `npm install` to get all the programs necessary to run the bot.
Run the bot via `npm start`, though that said, the login code would likely need to change and point to your own discord server... more details on that later.
